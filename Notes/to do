### to do later:
check new annotations functionality
shift all my user plugins to 3.8 finally
use ctrl ctrl to add a mark and define custom marks which nicely underline the mark area and are re-moved whenever the transpose command is called

check View.text_point() and related functions now accept a clamp_column parameter
check API: View.show() now takes keep_to_left and animate

show_quick_panel now accepts placeholder text, via the placeholder
When renaming a file, the extension is now excluded from the initial selection, check if thers a builtin rename command?
check if that triggers a command: Folders in the sidebar can be recursively expanded via alt+arrow key
keybinds:
	Join Lines is now on Ctrl+Shift+J / Cmd+Shift+J
	Expand Selection to Indentation is no longer bound by default
	Ctrl+J / Cmd+J is now used as a prefix for sequential key bindings, similar to Ctrl+K / Cmd+K

recheck go to anything (can go to to line number directly also)

Added Selection/Expand Selection as a general mechanism to expand the selection
check the difference in Swap Lines?
Tabs, Open Files entries, Goto File, Goto Symbol in Project, Goto Definition and the Definitions popup now support using the alt modifier to replace the current file with the selected file, add this to my custom file menus too perhaps?
Goto File, Goto Symbol in Project, Goto Definition and the Definitions popup now support the ctrl/cmd modifier to open the file in addition to the current file ( i think this means split view not sure?)
Added a New Tab button in the tab bar, and hide_new_tab_button setting
ctrl+shift+l splits a selection into words if its a single line :o
tab menu has Close Deleted Files

Holding down Shift on Windows, or Option on macOS, will start Sublime Text in Safe Mode (Safe Mode is now activated via shift+alt)
